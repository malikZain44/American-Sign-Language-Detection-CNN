# American-Sign-Language-Detection-CNN

Working:
This project focuses on building a deep learning-based model to recognize and classify American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The main objective is to enable real-time and accurate detection of ASL alphabets, which can help bridge communication gaps for hearing-impaired individuals.

The process begins with loading a dataset containing thousands of labeled images of hand gestures, each corresponding to a letter in the ASL alphabet. These images are preprocessed (resized, normalized, and converted into arrays) to ensure consistency and improve training performance.

A CNN model is then designed and trained on this dataset. The CNN architecture typically includes convolutional layers (to extract spatial features), pooling layers (to reduce dimensionality), and fully connected layers (to perform classification). The model learns to recognize patterns, edges, shapes, and other visual features unique to each ASL gesture.

After training, the model is evaluated using validation and test datasets to check its accuracy and robustness. It is then capable of classifying new images of hand gestures into their corresponding ASL alphabet. The trained model can be integrated into applications such as gesture recognition systems, assistive technologies, or educational tools.
